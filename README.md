# employee-directory

A full stack app for browsing a list of employees at an imaginary company.

## Getting started

The app is split into `client` and `server` directories. `client` contains the frontend UI, which consists of a React / Redux application. `server` contains the backend API, which is built with GraphQL and Dgraph.

### Starting up the `client`

1. From the `client` folder, run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm start` to start up the dev server and listen for changes

### Starting up the `server`
